# Diary Project

Track myself. 

Everyone considers him a genius of some kind. Many have the habit of taking notes and record what's coming and going in their minds. Some are ambitious and wish to change the world with some of their ideas. Diary projects has a heart beating powerfully.

meet people with same interests and ideas

Diary Project is more than publishing or sharing in a circle. It aims at practically solving problems. People meet to find something to do. Anyway I want to do something and everything I write down has a target. What steps can I take and what specific job I can do so that my life and our lives can be better? Then I'll do them on daily basis actively. 

I believe many are doing similar jobs and i start to reach out my hands.

keep everything online orderly. 

Fragmented ideas sleeping in the hard disk of the desktop is lifeless and messy. they need to be sorted out for the purpose of sharing and personal reference. writing for others forces yourself to be clear and concrete.

I find this is the future of writing, write for a collaborative project, to make something happen.to get together for better ideas, to work out a plan and implement it, not by assigning jobs but by requesting jobs. The framework of git is perfect for project managing of any kind.
